Overview
========

The *of.flow-manager* application exports a REST API to add, remove,
list and clean flows from switches. It can be used by others
applications to manage all flows.

This applications creates an abstraction layer to other applications,
since it is only necessary to know only the endpoints. The application
takes care to handle the requests and return the information already
formatted (all endpoints that receive a ``GET`` returns an JSON file).

Installing
==========

This is a default Kytos Network Application and the installation process is
straight forward: Just copy the ``kytos/of_flow-manager`` directory to your
napps directory. The default path is ``/var/lib/kytos/napps/``.

.. note:: Please note that you must copy from the root of the napp (including
    the ``kyto`` folder). So you will have
    ``/var/lib/kytos/napps/kytos/of_flow-manager`` at the end.

If you are going to install the whole repository, with all napps, you do not
have to worry about the above procedings, since all napps will be copied into
the correct napps folder during the installation process.

Protocol Operation
------------------

The endpoints implemented by this napp is presented in table below.

+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| Endpoint                               | Description                      | Method     |
+========================================+==================================+============+
| ``/flow-manager/dpid/flows``           | Retrieve flows from a specific   | ``GET``    |
|                                        | Switch                           |            |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| ``/flow-manager/flows``                | Retrieve all flows               | ``GET``    |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| ``/flow-manager/dpid/flows-a`` Â        | Add a flow in a specific Switch  | ``POST``   |
|                                        |                                  |            |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
| ``/flow-manager/dpid/flow_id/flows-d`` | Delete a flow from a specific    | ``DELETE`` |
|                                        | Switch                           |            |

How it Works
------------

An application that wishes to use this application, can use http
methods, such as ``GET``,\ ``POST`` and ``DELETE`` to request or send an
information to the napp. All endpoints of this napp returns a JSON
response as described below.

Endpoint ``/flow-manager/dpid/flows``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a JSON with all flows of a specific switch identified by the
DPID.

Endpoint ``/flow-manager/flows``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a JSON with all flows of all switches.

Endpoint ``/flow-manager/dpid/flows-a``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a JSON with success message.

Endpoint ``/flow-manager/dpid/flow_id/flows-d``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a JSON with success message.
